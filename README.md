# Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis

## Overview

This project uses the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to conduct customer segmentation analysis on an online retail dataset sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail).

## Data Source

The dataset for this analysis can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail).

## Key Steps

1. **Data Importing**: Load the online retail dataset using Pandas.

2. **Data Preparation & Exploration**: Handle missing values, explore categorical data, and clean the dataset.

3. **RFM Analysis**: Calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer.

4. **Customer Segmentation**: Segment customers based on RFM scores.

5. **Segment Analysis**: Analyze distinct customer segments in terms of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics.

## Findings

- **Cleaned Dataset**: Missing values and canceled orders were handled for a cleaner dataset.

- **RFM Model**: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values were calculated, forming the basis for segmentation.

- **Segmentation Results**: Customers were grouped into segments based on RFM scores, revealing patterns in their behavior.



## Notes

- Basic Python and data analysis knowledge assumed.
- Further analysis or machine learning models can be added for deeper insights.
